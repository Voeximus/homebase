# Homebase — Session Handoff / Current State

_Last updated: 2026-06-19 (LIVE BANK FEED). This is the regrounding doc for resuming work on Homebase. Read this first, then `C:\Users\ginoc\.claude\projects\C--\memory\project_homebase.md` for the deep history._

> **⭐ Homebase now has a LIVE Plaid bank feed.** Gino's real Bank of America accounts auto-sync (balances + categorized transactions). The old manual/reconciled data was wiped (full backup taken); **Plaid is now the source of truth.** See **"⭐ Live bank feed"** below. The pre-Plaid baseline is kept only for historical reference.
>
> **⚠️ This repo is PUBLIC — never commit credentials, secrets, or the financial-data backup.**

> **⭐⭐ 2026-06-19 — FINANCE MODE WAS FULLY RESKINNED + RESTRUCTURED (shipped as the DEFAULT, live). Much of the "Mission Control one-pager" language below is now HISTORICAL.**
> Finance mode is now a bright **4-tab bento app: Home · Insights · Activity · Profile**, in `src/views/redesign/`:
> - `FinanceTabs.tsx` — the container (`useStore` → builds view-models via `buildVMs.ts`; a working Finance/Health + Mine/Household top bar; renders the 4 tabs + all the sheets).
> - Presentational tabs `HomeTab` / `InsightsTab` / `ActivityTab` / `ProfileTab`; bento sheets `BillsSheet` / `CategorySheet` / `TxnSheet`; palette `lib/catColor.ts` (`catColor`/`catIcon`/`BRAND_GRADIENT`/`conicFromSegments`).
> - `App.tsx FinanceGate` renders `FinanceTabs` by **default**; **`?oldui`** falls back to the original `OnePager` (kept ONLY because the new UI imports its exported sheets: SprintSheet/MarkSentSheet/PayBillSheet/AccountsSheet/SettingsSheet; the standalone LedgerSheet/AddTransactionSheet/ImportSheet are reused too). `?lab` = the no-login design lab (`DesignLab.tsx`, mock data) for verifying the new UI without auth.
> - **Bills** now live on the Home tab (a tile → `BillsSheet`: upcoming list + "X paid" + a tappable money calendar; tap a bill → `PayBillSheet`).
> - Budget = **7 lines** now (added a **Pets** category): Groceries500/Gas250/Dining150/Household90/Health110/Pets100/Subs50 = $1,250.
> - **⭐ NEXT TASK: fix the FUZZY BILL-MATCHING** so a real bank bill-payment auto-flips the correct recurring bill (edit the Plaid edge fn categorizer's recurring-name match → normalized/fuzzy via `merchantKey` + learned `merchant_rules` bill rules). Then: repaint the reused OnePager sheet *interiors* bento; wire feed-income recording.
> - Categories are **code-driven** (`src/lib/seed.ts DEFAULT_CATEGORIES`, not a DB table). Verification gotcha: `preview_screenshot`/async `preview_eval` **time out** (Vite HMR socket blocks network-idle) — use **synchronous** `preview_eval` DOM reads, and split click→read across separate eval calls so React flushes. The authed app can't be lab-verified (no login in preview) → typecheck+build guard those.

## What it is
A personal finance **+ health** PWA for **Gino** and his wife **Xinyan**, used daily on their phones. One app, **two modes** toggled at the top:
- **Finance** — a debt-payoff "Mission Control" one-pager.
- **Health** — two-person diet/training plans + a calibration gauge + a macro meal builder.

The unifying idea: the app is a **calibration instrument** — Finance calibrates money off the ledger, Health calibrates two bodies off the weekly scale. "Measure, don't infer."

## Live + repo + deploy
- **Live:** https://voeximus.github.io/homebase/ (GitHub Pages, installable PWA).
- **Repo:** github.com/Voeximus/homebase (authed `gh` account **Voeximus**).
- **Deploy:** push to `main` → GitHub Actions builds + deploys (~60–90s). `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Build secrets `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` are set in the repo.
- Local path: `C:\Users\ginoc\Documents\homebase`.

## ⭐ Live bank feed (Plaid) — 2026-06-19
Homebase pulls **real Bank of America** balances + transactions automatically (read-only). **Bank = truth:** a connected account's balance is overwritten by the bank's number each sync; transactions are history + budget fuel, not balance-movers — so drift is impossible. Provider = **Plaid, "lean" mode** (cron/on-demand sync, no public webhook), chosen over SimpleFIN/Teller after deep research (free Trial plan ≤10 bank logins, true OAuth, native pending→posted, paved React path).

**Backend (Supabase `ganzefaciiyibselizqi`):**
- `supabase/schema_v8_bankfeed.sql` (RUN) — `bank_connections`, `pending_preview`, transactions provenance cols (`provider`, `provider_txn_id`, `status`, `needs_review`) + partial unique index, accounts cols (`connection_id`, `provider_account_id`, `balance_synced_at`), and `get_connection_token()` — a SECURITY DEFINER **service-role-only** reader of the bank token from **Supabase Vault** (token never reaches the client).
- `supabase/schema_v9_bankfeed_rpc.sql` (RUN) — `store_connection()` (stash token in Vault + open a connection) + `apply_bank_sync()` (atomically upsert posted rows, idempotent on provider_txn_id, + set the account's bank-truth balance). Service-role-only.
- **Edge Function `supabase/functions/plaid/index.ts`** — one multiplexed function: actions `link_token` / `exchange` / `sync` / `disconnect`. Holds the Plaid secret + bank token server-side ONLY; JWT-verified. Imports `_shared/plaidSync.ts` (the `reconcile()` pending→posted engine) + `_shared/categorize.ts` + `_shared/categorizeData.ts` (the full trained categorizer, **copied** from `src/lib` — keep in sync). `pickBalance()`: depository → **available** (spendable), credit → **current** (owed). Only "variable" living-spend is inserted; income/transfers/bills skipped.
- **Deploy:** `npx supabase functions deploy plaid --project-ref ganzefaciiyibselizqi` with `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env (a personal token "Hombase", revocable in Supabase → Account → Access Tokens). Secrets (`PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV=production`, `PLAID_REDIRECT_URI`) are in **Supabase function secrets — NOT the repo.** Docker not needed (CLI bundles via API).

**Frontend:**
- **Connect a bank** in `SettingsSheet` (OnePager) via `react-plaid-link`. `lib/plaidClient.ts` + `components/PlaidOAuthReturn.tsx` (mounted in `App.tsx Shell`; resumes Link after a bank's OAuth redirect — real banks need OAuth + a `redirect_uri` registered in Plaid → Developers → API → Allowed redirect URIs = `https://voeximus.github.io/homebase/`).
- **The Ledger** — `components/LedgerSheet.tsx`, reached via **Activity → "All activity."** Every transaction with its budget fate (→ envelope / "Bill · not in budget" / amber "Needs review"), search + All/In-budget/Needs-review filters, grouped by month. **One-tap re-categorize that TEACHES** (`setTransactionCategory` + `saveMerchantRule`) = the categorizer-training bench, plus the merchant-policy controls below.
- **`totalBalance` excludes credit accounts** (`lib/recurring.ts`) so a card never inflates cash. New store actions: `excludeFromBudget` (mark a one-off → out of variable spend) + `makeRecurringBill(txnId, cadence)` (promote a sub to a bill).

**Merchant = policy (the categorizer vision, locked with Gino):** a merchant isn't one category, it's a policy — **Fixed** (Safeway→groceries), **Ask** (gas/Sam's: per-purchase), **Recurring** (sub→bill). Built: the recategorize sheet's **"✓ Remember merchant / Just this one"** toggle (Ask merchants — a gas-station snack → **Dining** without making all gas dining), and **"Repeats monthly/yearly?"** → `makeRecurringBill` (sub becomes a calendar bill, leaves variable spend, teaches a bill rule). **NOT yet built:** the **Sam's-Club split** (one charge → $X groceries + $Y household, by dollar — **NEXT**) and the **card→debt wiring** (below).

**⭐ CURRENT LIVE STATE (post-wipe, Plaid is truth):** Gino's BofA connected (status ok). Accounts: **Adv Plus Banking $1,306.67** (Gino's checking, the old "Geo"), **Adv SafeBalance $15.48** (the **JOINT** — re-tagged owner Joint; available balance), **BankAmericard $4,156.78** (the **…4728 card**). **57** plaid transactions. Debts (5) / recurring (14) / merchant_rules (6) intact. The **…4728 card is a credit-typed account EXCLUDED from cash** — but **NOT yet wired to the …4728 debt**; the debt is still the manual $4,156.78 row. Categorizer audit found ~21/57 needing attention (Remitly remittances + card interest in "other"; Chipotle/Canes/7-Eleven/itch.io dict misses) → Gino triages in the Ledger.

**Decisions locked this session:** card spending **tracked** (max fidelity; Gino won't use …4728 going forward); China-trip one-offs (Remitly to Xinyan, SWA/passport fees) **skipped**; gas snacks → **Dining**; subscriptions → **bills**; splits **by dollar**.

**⚠️ The wipe (2026-06-19):** old manual accounts + transactions + sandbox test data cleared so BofA could connect into a clean slate; **debts + recurring + merchant_rules + goals KEPT.** Full pre-wipe backup at `_homebase_backup_2026-06-19T*.json` (repo root, **gitignored**, restorable).

**⭐ Auto-sync (2026-06-19):** the feed syncs **on every app open** (App.tsx `syncNow()`) + a **Refresh** button in the Activity header (`force=true` → `/transactions/refresh` nudge, then sync). No background cron yet (offered). Honest ceiling: Plaid pulls ~1–4×/day + the bank's own pending lag → **same-day loop, not minutes-after-swipe.** `lib/plaidClient.ts syncNow(force)`.

**⭐ Bills precision (2026-06-19) — variable bills + the feed records bill payments:**
- `recurring.variable` flag (**schema_v10, RUN**). A variable bill projects from `billExpected(bill, txns)` (`lib/plan.ts`) = **rolling average of its last 3 actual `appliesTo=bill` payments** (fallback to modeled amount); fixed bills keep the modeled amount.
- **Injected DISPLAY-ONLY** — `monthlySchedule(recurring, monthKey, transactions)` (`schedule.ts`) uses billExpected for variable out-bills → calendar/chips/upcoming show the estimate; **householdMonthly / planMath / payoffSchedule stay on contracted amounts**, so firepower + the countdown are insulated (load-bearing safety rule).
- **The feed now RECORDS bill payments** (skipped them before): a posted bill-classified txn is matched to its recurring (`billName`→name; post-day snapped to nearest `due_days`), written `appliesTo={kind:bill,recurringId,monthKey,day,settled:true}` with the real amount → **auto-marks paid + logs the actual.** Idempotent (provider_txn_id unique) + dedups vs manual (`paidBill` set). **schema_v11 (RUN)** makes `apply_bank_sync` carry `applies_to`. New `setRecurringVariable` action.
- **Electric (SRP) + Verizon** are the only variable bills, flagged + **seeded** with Mar–May actuals from `MasterLedger.csv` → project **~$89.92 / ~$82.83** now. Every bill carries `due_days`, so the feed↔calendar day-match is solid (**verified**).
- ✅ **Pay-early auto-mark-paid VERIFIED:** pay a bill early (same month) → feed sees it → snaps to due day → marks paid + logs actual + re-averages. Caveats: bank/Plaid latency (hours); paying a *full month* ahead marks the wrong month.

**PENDING (bank feed):**
1. **⭐ 3 bills-precision polish items (NEXT — Gino wants ALL 3):** (a) a **toggle UI** to flag a bill variable (now set via script; extend PayBillSheet or add a small BillEditSheet from the Bills container — `setRecurringVariable` exists); (b) an **"~est" badge** on variable chips (ScheduleEntry carries `variable`); (c) an **editable amount at pay-time** for variable bills (PayBillSheet, OnePager ~1883-1918).
2. **Sam's-Club split** (one charge → $X groceries + $Y household, by dollar) — waits on Li's card to test.
3. **Card → …4728 debt auto-update** — DESIGNED (`debts.provider_account_id` + `link_debt_to_provider`/`set_debt_balance` RPCs; route credit accounts to the debt) but **NOT built/run** (schema_v12). Card excluded from cash; debt is manual $4,156.78.
4. **Li (Xinyan) connects HER BofA** on her phone.
5. **Yearly** sub→bill calendar rendering unverified (monthly solid).
6. **🔒 Confirm the test-account backdoor was DELETED** in Supabase Auth (exposed in this PUBLIC repo). Maintenance now uses the **service-role key** via the "Hombase" access token (`npx supabase projects api-keys`).

## Stack + dev workflow
- Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + lucide-react. Supabase (Postgres + auth + realtime). vite-plugin-pwa. @zxing/browser (barcode, lazy). pdfjs-dist (PDF import, lazy).
- **Run dev server:** `preview_start` name **`homebase`** (config `C:\.claude\launch.json`, port 5173). The **serverId rotates every session and dies between sessions** — call `preview_start` to get a fresh one; if screenshots start timing out (the realtime websocket blocks network-idle on a long-lived page), **stop + start a fresh server** for a clean screenshot window. Mobile viewport: `preview_resize` 390×844.
- **Build/typecheck:** `npm run build`. **PATH refresh required first** in PowerShell:
  `$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','Machine') + ';' + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User')`
- **Commit messages:** write to a temp file and `git commit -F file` (heredoc/inline quoting breaks on the `"`/`'` in messages). End with the Co-Authored-By trailer.
- **preview_click does NOT reach React** in this env (synthetic events). To click in-app, use `preview_eval` with a real DOM `.click()`. Reading state: `preview_eval` / `preview_snapshot` / `preview_inspect` (reliable); screenshots work on a fresh server but flake on a stale one.

## Architecture
Provider tree: `App → AuthProvider → AuthGate → FinanceProvider → Shell → LanguageProvider → (OnePager | HealthView)`.
- **AuthProvider** (`auth/AuthProvider.tsx`) — Supabase email/password session.
- **FinanceProvider** (`store/FinanceStore.tsx`) — THE data store: loads all tables, realtime-subscribes, and exposes the **pipelined money engine** (`applyMoneyEvent` moves cash + writes a ledger row + fans out to a linked debt/goal) plus actions: `payBill`, `payDebtExtra`, `markBillPaid`, `commitImport`, `setAccountBalance`, `setTransactionCategory`, `excludeFromBudget`, `makeRecurringBill`, `deleteTransaction`, `saveMerchantRule`, `addFood`/`deleteFood`, `seedHousehold`, `resetAll`.
- **Shell** (`App.tsx`) — holds `mode` ('finance'|'health', `hb-mode`), `owner` ('gino'|'xinyan', `hb-owner`), `lens` ('me'|'all', `hb-lens`), and in-memory `entered`. While not `entered` it renders `WelcomeScreen` (the front door, shown every cold launch); after, OnePager / HealthView with owner + lens props.
- **LanguageProvider** (`components/LanguageProvider.tsx`) — holds `lang` ('en'|'zh', `hb-lang`); **remounts its children via `key={lang}`** so every module-level `t()` re-evaluates on toggle (no data refetch since it's below FinanceProvider).

## Features + key files
**Finance — `views/OnePager.tsx`** (one scrolling page; sticky collapsing header + jump-chip scroll-spy):
- Hero "next move" (the VERB — what to send, when, split across debts, from `payoffSchedule`); "Mark sent" → confirm sheet loops `payDebtExtra`.
- Cash + 90-day streak ring · debt "runner road" to the Nov '26 finish · firepower + spent · 6-envelope budget (drill→relabel/delete) · bills chips + collapsed calendar + coming-up · activity + log/import + floating ＋. SettingsSheet (seed/import/clear) lives at the bottom of this file.
- Math/data: `lib/plan.ts` (planMath, orderedDebts, payoffSchedule, commitmentProgress, variableSpentThisMonth, spentByCategory, lineSpent, LEAN_VARIABLE, UPCOMING_INCOME, ONE_TIMES, HABITS, SAVINGS_SPLIT), `lib/schedule.ts`, `lib/recurring.ts`, `lib/household.ts` (SEED_*), `lib/format.ts`.
- Import/categorizer: `lib/{importStatement,importPdf,categorize,categorizeData}.ts` + `components/ImportSheet.tsx` (CSV+PDF, trained on his MasterLedger, dedup, NPC clarify-cards → `merchant_rules`).

**Health — `views/HealthView.tsx`** (sub-toggle `hb-health-sub` = 'plan'|'kitchen'):
- PLAN: per-person Gino(BUILD)/Xinyan(CUT) toggle (`hb-health-person`), accents Gino `#ef8136` / Xinyan `#2dd1c0`. Snapshot, daily-fuel macros, training (4 sessions + 5-week table), why-it-works, the calibration gauge (enter 7-day weight + weeks → rate → verdict; Xinyan also progress-to-118). Inputs persist per-person in localStorage.
- KITCHEN: **`views/MealBuilder.tsx`** + **`lib/nutrition.ts`** — pick ingredients → per-person grams. `solveMeal(foods, target)` fills veg→carbs→protein→fat to each person's meal target (settable ⅓/½/full-day) so one plate yields two portions; flags overshoots. ~24 seeded foods + custom foods.
- Barcode: **`components/BarcodeScanner.tsx`** (back camera via @zxing, lazy) + **`lib/barcode.ts`** (OpenFoodFacts lookup, free/no-key) → prefill the Add-Food form. Camera needs HTTPS (works on the live site; untested in preview = no camera).

**i18n (English / 简体中文)** — `lib/i18n.ts` (`t(s, vars?)`, module-level current lang) + `lib/i18n_zh.ts` (hand-curated SEED) + `lib/i18n_zh_auto.ts` (~464 workflow-generated translations; SEED overrides on conflict). Toggle = `LangToggle` (中/EN) in both headers. ~470 strings wrapped across the views/components; interpolated sentences use `{placeholder}` templates so word order is correct; money/dates/names/dynamic-data stay raw; untranslated → English fallback.

**PWA / mobile** — `vite.config.ts` (manifest, theme `#0a0d12`, icons incl. 1024px), `index.html` (viewport-fit=cover, theme-color), `public/favicon.svg` (graphite house, cyan→green) + generated icons, `pwa-assets.config.ts` (`@vite-pwa/assets-generator` devDep, dark bg / no white padding). Touch polish + safe-areas in `index.css` (the instrument theme `@theme` tokens live here too).

**Welcome + owner lens (NEW 2026-06-19)** — `components/WelcomeScreen.tsx` is the front gate (gated in `Shell` via in-memory `entered`, so it shows every cold launch). First launch → "whose phone is this?" → "you're {name}?" confirm → binds the device (`lib/owner.ts`, `hb-owner`); thereafter it greets by name + shows the **throw-rail** (a filled two-segment Finance/Health switch) → throw to enter. The owner is then a **lens** (`lib/lens.ts` filters + persisted `hb-lens`, default `me`; `components/LensToggle.tsx` Mine/Household in each header): **Finance · Mine** = your accounts' cash (Joint as a small line) + your activity, with the shared next-move + sprint on top and budget/bills collapsed (also off the jump chips); **Health · Mine** = locks to the owner and hides the person toggle. "Household" restores the full picture in both. The household math is unchanged — the lens only changes display. Owner-change-in-Settings: offered, NOT built (today: clear `hb-owner`).

## Data model + Supabase
- Project `ganzefaciiyibselizqi`, `https://ganzefaciiyibselizqi.supabase.co`. Auth email+password; **RLS = authenticated-full (shared household)**. Tables: accounts, recurring, transactions, debts, savings_goals, paid_bills, merchant_rules, **foods** (v6). DDL in `supabase/schema*.sql`.
- **Maintenance access** — credentials live in the **private agent memory only**, NEVER in this public file. Prefer the **service-role key** (fetched via the Supabase CLI with the access token) for live-data scripts; the legacy test-account backdoor is being retired (its creds were exposed in this public repo's history → delete that user + rotate). The publishable key `sb_publishable_907KbW_QmcTvL-wFHg-8yA_roZe8u_2` is the anon key — safe in the public bundle.

### Reconciled financial baseline — HISTORICAL (pre-Plaid; superseded by the live feed)
_The hand-reconciled manual data, **WIPED 2026-06-19** when the Plaid feed went live (full backup kept — see "Live bank feed"). Kept only for reference; live numbers now come from BofA._
Accounts: **Geo $1,566.26 · Xinyan $751.00 · Joint $18.74 = cash $2,336.00**. Debts: **Anthropic $99.10 · Amazon $189.68 · …6813 $591.09 · Mom-China $800 · …4728 $4,156.78 @26.49% = $5,836.65** (pre-test every debt is AT its original_balance — no prior payments recorded).

### ⚠️ NO SANDBOX (load-bearing)
Every tap in the deployed/preview app writes to the **live Supabase DB**. On 2026-06-18 Gino feature-tested thinking it was a sandbox → 7 stray `payDebtExtra` rows drove cash to −$266; restored exactly via a reversal script. **Health-mode food library + gauge + meal selection are local-first (localStorage) and do NOT touch Supabase** until `foods` syncs. A "practice mode" was offered, not built.

## OPEN ITEMS / pending Gino actions
1. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-18):** Gino ran `supabase/schema_v6.sql` — the `foods` table is live (RLS verified, reachable). **Food-library cloud sync is ON.** Each device's local foods migrate up on next open.
2. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-19):** new sign-ups are **disabled** in Supabase → Auth (verified by screenshot) — the open-signup hole the audit flagged is closed. RLS stays authenticated-full for the shared household; the test account still works.
3. To see the **new app icon** on a phone, remove + re-add the home-screen shortcut (PWA icons cache).
4. **Offered, not built:** owner-change in Settings (welcome owner currently changes only by clearing `hb-owner`); a "practice mode"/demo login (sandbox); logging the weekly scale over time (health trend).
6. **NEXT (Gino's plan):** redesign each mode's *layout* — how Finance and Health display info, now per **Mine vs Household** lens. The lens is the foundation; the layouts are the next pass.
5. **⚠️ NEVER re-seed** ("Clear all data" / re-seed wipes the reconciliation; merchant_rules + foods survive resetAll by design).

## Mode-layout redesign (2026-06-19) — lens-aware layouts
Each mode now has a distinct **Mine** vs **Household** layout:
- **Finance · Mine** — sticky header pins a 2-cell **vitals strip** (cash · debt); body = **upcoming bills** + your **activity**. No hero/sprint/budget.
- **Finance · Household** — a grid of **titled containers** (`ContainerCard`): Cash · Debt · Bills · Budget · Activity. `openContainer` state drills into one full-page (Debt = next-move hero + sprint + progress) with a `‹ All` back. Each section is gated `openContainer === "x"`; old jump-chips/`SECTIONS`/`useActiveSection` removed.
- **Health · Mine** — curated dashboard: `MacroNeeds` (from `lib/nutrition` `DAILY`) + a big **Scan a barcode** button (→ Meal Builder tab) + `PersonalWorkouts` (compact). Meal Builder is the other sub-tab.
- **Health · Household** — the full per-person plan (Gino/Xinyan toggle + `GinoPlan`/`XinyanPlan`), unchanged.
- Follow-up: the Health "Scan a barcode" button navigates to the Meal Builder tab; wiring it to auto-open the scanner (autoScan prop through MealBuilder→AddFoodSheet) is a refinement, not done.

## Backend audit (2026-06-19)
A 25-agent code audit + a read-only live-data check. **Live data is pristine** (cash $2,336.00, debts $5,836.65 all at original, 0 orphans, 0 non-reversible rows). Verified-correct: ledger math + exact reversibility (appliedAmount), the two earlier-fixed bugs, no-double-move on settled markers, lens-is-display-only, only the anon key in the bundle. Fixes shipped: SEED Xinyan 1095.75→751.00 (`89dd9cb`); **fail-closed money writes** — `applyMoneyEvent` now captures each balance-write error and `resyncLedger()`s to server truth so the UI can't keep a value that didn't persist (`5d69461`). **✅ `supabase/schema_v7_rpc.sql` RUN (Gino, 2026-06-19) + verified ($0 round-trip) + engine WIRED** — `FinanceStore.applyMoneyEvent` now calls `supabase.rpc("apply_money_event", …)` and `deleteTransaction` calls `reverse_money_event`, so the ledger row + cash/debt/goal move (or reverse) in ONE atomic transaction with in-row deltas (audit #2/#4 closed; `8edf108`). The old multi-step absolute-write path is gone; on any rpc error the client `resyncLedger()`s. Secondary direct-balance setters (`setAccountBalance`, `payDebt`, `contributeGoal`) still do absolute writes — lower-traffic, could move to deltas in a later pass. Import dedup is client-only (low risk: imported rows carry account_id:null, never double-move the anchored baseline) — a DB unique index is the durable fix.

## Working with Gino (style)
Director/game-designer; AI-paired build. WHAT is his, HOW is mine. One piece at a time, design-lens language, no yes-man, state confidence, measure-don't-infer, never manufacture scope panic. He test-drives live (his loop is test→insight→architecture). Reconcile/setup chores: **do them FOR him** via script, never hand him manual setup. Full collaboration detail in the memory files (`feedback_*`).
